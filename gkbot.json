	"origin": ["Well here we are again, I’ve been here before\nBut I couldn't tell you when","Now every step I take is on the line\nAnd each move right wipes out what's left behind","Well here we are this time, it starts again\nBut I really don't know why","A misplaced step a single slip or fall\nIt's back to one-dash-one, I've lost it all","If I'm stuck I'll call you (Down with the king! Down with the king!)\nWith each stage I’ll move through (Down with the king! Down with the king!)","Well I’ll know just a little more (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)\nEach step alone brings us closer to that old throne (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)","So now I’ll set the pace\nWith such short time, yeah, I really must make haste","But I don't know what's ahead or what the ending will bring\nI just need to take a minute and then try again to take out the king","If I'm stuck I'll call you (Down with the king! Down with the king!)\nWith each stage I’ll move through (Down with the king! Down with the king!)","Well I’ll know just a little more (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)\nEach step alone brings us closer to that old throne (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)","If I'm stuck I'll call you (Down with the king! Down with the king!)\nWith each stage I’ll move through (Down with the king! Down with the king!)","Well I’ll know just a little more (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)\nEach step alone brings us closer to that old throne (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)","We couldn’t fallow the fields\nWe couldn’t live off the yields","And so we slowly slipped away\nIt was a city of jade","From the year it was made\nThen it started to decay","But I'm still here\nLost everything, everything","But I know that it will fall\nThe crumbling walls","And it’s all that is left to me\nIt seems like we’re in withdrawal","But so are they all\nAnd it’s all that is left to me","I write your name into stone\nAnd read it alone","And it’s all that is left to me\nYour love songs cover this home","But nobody knows\nAnd it’s all that is left to me","And in the temple divine\nCan’t tell the writing from vines","But then I know just what they’ll say\n'Here stood a mightier kind'","Tikal and Copan combined\nBut then they started to decay","But I'm still here\nLost everything, everything","But I know that it will fall\nThe crumbling walls","And it’s all that is left to me\nIt seems like we’re in withdrawal","But so are they all\nAnd it’s all that is left to me","I write your name into stone\nAnd read it alone","And it’s all that is left to me\nYour love songs cover this home","But nobody knows\nAnd it’s all that is left to me","I know that it will fall\nThe crumbling walls","And it’s all that is left to me\nIt seems like we’re in withdrawal","But so are they all\nAnd it’s all that is left to me","I write your name into stone\nAnd read it alone","And it’s all that is left to me\nYour love songs cover this home","But nobody knows\nAnd it’s all that is left to me","Well I've been waiting for all these years just to see you come back home\nBut each step that you took towards her, well, you took each one alone","And every time you said: 'My god, how is it up there on that throne?'\nWell I've been waiting undefeated just to hear you say that I'm not needed","I said I was an honest man\nYou said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it","Well I think you're just afraid of the fall\nBut you won't be there at all, no you won't be there and","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\nMy god, I hope you're falling if you","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\nIt's going to be the start of what you are","Well I remember when you said that you hate everything I do\nYou didn't have a reason then, wish I'd given one to you","And then you would say: 'Oh, my, god, I couldn't know what you'd been through'\nWell I've been waiting undefeated just to hear you say that I'm not needed","I said I was an honest man\nYou said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it","Well I think you're just afraid of the fall\nBut you won't be there at all, no you won't be there and","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\nMy god, I hope you're falling if you","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\nIt's going to be the start of what you are","I said I was an honest man\nYou said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it","Well I think you're just afraid of the fall\nBut you won't be there at all, no you won't be there","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\n(Said I was an honest man)\nMy god, I hope you're falling if you\n(Said I wasn't at all, I wasn't at all)","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\n(Said I was an honest man)\nIt's going to be the start of what you\n(Said I wasn't at all, I wasn't at all)","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\n(Said I was an honest man)\nMy god, I hope you're falling if you\n(Said I wasn't at all, I wasn't at all)","Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart\n(Said I was an honest man)\nIt's going to the start of what you are","A pox, a pox, upon this ground\nI'd give it up just to burn it down","And if they die here you can blame it on me\nI've been setting up gravestones in my hometown","I wish I had been born at sea\nThen you wouldn't care, and you wouldn't know me","Ebb and flow, they just won't carry me home\nIt's only water and air as far as I can see","There was a time when you would let me know\nBecause your words weren’t taken by your indigo","And i could write it all down in a matter of lines\nTo read back what we had from a previous time","My ancestral passage here\nWas written down each year by year","But the map is too old, see they’ve forgotten the roads\nAnd so we're living by the creases","A pox, a pox, upon this town\nI'd give it up just to burn it down","And if they die here you can blame it on me\nI've been setting up gravestones in my hometown","I wish I had been born at sea\nThen you wouldn't care, and you wouldn't know me","Ebb and flow, they just won't carry me home\nIts only water and air as far as I can see","These days all I see is everything you're not\nBetween those melodies, it's all I've been thinking of","Since then the lines you left behind you\nThey cover every bit of this home","These days it's all I've ever wanted\nIt's all I've ever wanted to know","What it is that keeps me from letting you go\nI don't even know","What it is that keeps me from letting you go\nIt's not what I thought","I guess we get what we want\nThese days all I hear are words that I forgot","And of those memories, I'd rather lose the lot\nSince then the days are getting longer but I keep getting lost in the snow","I guess we get what we want","Sorry, baby, I just don't know the words\nOr how to conjugate them","Was it really past tense I heard?\nOr was it present perfect?","Maybe we could forget the time\nYou faced that friend without me","Maybe we could go back to mine\nPretend it never happened","Oh, when you’re always out of time\nWhen you say it will be fine","When I just can’t find the line\nOh, hope I know what to say","When you throw it all away","Sorry, baby, I've been drifting again\nCould you repeat the question?","No, I guess I do not know when\nIt first became a problem","Sorry that it's all such a mess\nThe words, they seem to leave me","Didn't really quite catch the rest\nNot keen on it repeating","Oh, when you’re always out of time\nWhen you say it will be fine","When I just can’t find the line\nOh, hope I know what to say","When you throw it all away\nWhen you throw it all away","Sorry, baby, I just don't know the words\nWas it really past tense I heard?","Maybe we can forget the time\nMaybe we can go back to mine","Well, I think that I've been drifting\nWithout you, drifting","I think that I've been drifting\nWithout you, drifting","And now I know that you've been gone","Four eyes entwined draw four separate lines\nAnd none of them point to you","A tangled mess of knots, I confess\nBut the intent was there I swear\nWe set our sights on something that we thought was true","So now we sit and stare across\nA surface spanning the whole state","Two feet between and miles apart\nNo words to speak, been here a week\nAnd still we haven't got a clue","It falls apart there's not a heart to beat there\nIt falls apart if there's not a heart to have","Each word a world all of its own\nEach thought rendered only in groans","The syntax skips semantics slips\bAnd what was left a growing cleft\nOf language lost, tokens unknown","And then I guess we slipped right through\nAnd lost all meaning on the way","We ended up a tiny piece\nOf every heart\nOf every part\nOf every stone\nOf every grave","Well I lost my phone maybe three years back\nAnd I don't have an address, it's a matter of fact\nBut I guess you tried to drop me a line","Yeah I signed out and I unsubscribed\nThen I cut the cord, now I'm not online\nBut I'll be fine, yeah I guess that I'll get by","Well I shaved my head and I grew out a beard\nNow I only wear plaid, I always look austere\nI'm moving to LA, I'm writing a screenplay","But it's not about you or what we were\nIt's about a new girl, you've never met her\nShe's just got your name\nAnd she looks exactly the same","Tell tell tell tell tell tell me you know\nTell me it's okay\nThat I dropped right off the map\nAnd I'm falling every day","Tell tell tell tell tell tell me you know\nTell me it's okay\n'Cause you'll find me anyway","Yeah if you see me walking by\nWell I guarantee it's some other guy\n'Cause I'm not there\nI'm always elsewhere","I changed my name, I had it approved\nThey wrote it down, you won't see it soon\nI guess you'll see there's not much to me\nI guess of me there's not much to see","And now, you'll see\nThat there's not much left of me","Well once a year I'll cross your path\nI'll hurry away, you'll stifle a laugh\nIt's not that I'm scared, you just caught me unaware","Well I know it's been a couple of years\nBut still, I'm surprised we ended up here\nWe'll talk a bit to see what we've lost\nYou'll stop when you see you're a bit better off","Give it up\nGive it up\nGive it away\nWell you were barely alive and you learnt that day","Cut off so much\nHardly remained\nWell you knew that there was still a way","Cry and cave in, try anyway\nWell you got him back, but then you had to pay","Stand up\nPush us\nStill to this day\nYou knew that there was still a way","This is your only plan, oh, nowThis is your only\nNow this is your only plan, oh, now\nThis is yours","That's fine\nIt's all you've ever known\nA single state of mind\nBut you won't ever let it go","When you had the answer\nAnd you were there alone\nYou left the door unopened\nWhen you knew that you would want more","Give it up\nGive it up\nGive it away\nWell you were barely aware you learned that day","Cut off so much\nHardly remained\nWell you knew that there was still a way","This is your only plan, oh, now\nThis is your only\nNow this is your only plan, oh, now\nThis is yours","And you're right\nYou force it to yield\nYou'll forge it to the lines","You let your callous be your shield\nAnd everyone will say\nThat it all was finished years ago\nBut you will stay\nAnd you won't ever let it go","Then again you found the answer\nThen you were there alone\nYou left the door unopened\nWhen you knew that you would want more","A narrative waste of patches and light\nWe grew up in the suburbs then we cut all our ties\nNow just take a look at this through Gwyllion eyes\nYou're wrong my friend, the road, it bends a bit to the right","A couple more miles and I know we'll arrive\nThese rolling hills and valleys, well they'll eat you alive\nNow the peat will grab our feet to halt the incline\nA little bit more lest we waste our whole lives","We got here in the dark\nWe took the long way down\nJust to find an inn somewhere inside this ancient town","We talked, we talked about it all night\nWe thought, we thought we'd make it alive\nWe talked, we talked about it all night\nWe thought, we thought we'd make it alive","We talked, we talked about it all night\nJust to throw the plan out at the first light\nWe thought, we thought we'd make it alive\nOr at least we'd give it an honest try","These stones were left here at the beginning of days\nAnd each step that was taken wore a little away\nThat in of itself, well it was something to say\nA conversation that could last the end of the day","Faster and faster, dear\nIt's like we're moving backwards\nIn a rear view mirror\nThe road evened out by the snow, evened out by-","I can feel\nI know you feel it too\nA little flicker on the path\nWe steer\nA set of flashing lights\nWe'll go faster and faster","This time, my mind\nIt won't forget\nThis time, my mind\nWe're not there yet\nThis time\nIt goes faster and faster","Faster and faster, dear\nThe road's still moving backwards\nNow it looks so clear\nThe snow evened out by the road, evened out by-","I can still call the twists and turns\nBut it feels so straight\nHead little farther till the end\nWe'll go faster and faster","This time, my mind\nIt won't forget\nThis time, my mind\nWe're not there yet\nThis time\nIt goes faster and faster","Baby if you don't stand for something\nHow can you ever stand at all\nBaby if you’re built on sand\nYou'll be swept back by the fall","Baby if you don't stand for something\nHow could you ever hope to\nHold the weight of everything you hold\nMaybe if you built your house on sand\nYou could burrow the deeper\nOr maybe it would cave on you alone","I swear I did I tried\nI swear I did\nA thousand times to let it lie\nA thousand times to let it lie","Baby if you don't stand for something\nHow could you ever hope to\nHold the weight of everything you hold\nMaybe if you show them all your hand\nYou could hide in the creases\nOr maybe you could take it back and fold","You said it was all in the aether\nEach thought that you said you could feed her\nShe said she was nothing but eager\nThen you said","She said that you couldn't believe her\nEach thought that you said you could feed her\nShe said it was all just to lead her then\nYou said you said you said you said you said-","I heard that you weren't sure\nThen I called it off again\nI heard that you weren't sure\nThen I called it off again","I’ve been, I’ve been thinking that\nI can't quite get enough time\nOn the inside of the cycle that you spin with\nGravity and dust, I’ve fallen in between the planets and the sun","Into the orbit that surrounds you\nThat orbit that’s around you\nThat orbit that surrounds you\nThat orbit that’s around you","Now the space is filling up\nSatellites that I can't seem to keep track of","I get the feeling I’m not quite made of the right stuff\nTo float between the rings of cosmic metal love","It's been a while\nI've been out on my own\nI get a little anxious when you call me on the phone","Somebody said that it\nIt fades away\nBut in the interim it was hard to see that way","It's been a while\nI've been out on my own\nI'm in denial about living life alone","I said I don't like change but I'm not afraid\nI can't keep it together ever anyway\nWhen every page is in disarray\nI think we'll be okay","I said I don't like change but I'm not afraid\nI can't keep it together ever anyway\nWhen every page is in disarray\nI think we'll be okay that way","I thought it'd change when i got older\nBut the same year came over and over\nAnd the only change that I could feel\nWas the aging of my bones","And then in one October\nWhen the sidewalk home was covered over\nWell I don't know the method\nBut you pulled life from the loam"]
